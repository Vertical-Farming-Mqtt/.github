# Vertical Farming MQTT

Welcome to the **Vertical Farming MQTT** organization!  
This organization contains firmware, libraries, and example projects for managing vertical farming systems using ESP32, MQTT, and Python.

---

## Repositories

### Libraries

- [vfarm_mqtt](https://github.com/Vertical-Farming-Mqtt/vfarm_mqtt)  
  Core MQTT library for ESP32 devices. Handles heartbeat, MQTT topics, and device communication.

### Firmware / MCU Examples

- [actuator](https://github.com/Vertical-Farming-Mqtt/actuator)  
  Example ESP32 firmware for actuators (pump and light) with MQTT control.

- [water_level_sensor](https://github.com/Vertical-Farming-Mqtt/water_level_sensor)  
  ESP32 firmware for water level sensor with MQTT reporting.

- [xiao_cam](https://github.com/Vertical-Farming-Mqtt/xiao_cam)  
  ESP32 camera firmware with image capture and MQTT integration.

### Python / Testing

- [py_mqtt_testing](https://github.com/Vertical-Farming-Mqtt/py_mqtt_testing)  
  Python scripts and Flask dashboard for testing devices, monitoring heartbeats, and controlling actuators via MQTT.

## Usage

- Start with the [vfarm_mqtt](https://github.com/Vertical-Farming-Mqtt/vfarm_mqtt) library for integrating MQTT in your devices.
- Use the firmware examples (`actuator`, `water_level_sensor`, `xiao_cam`) for reference.
- Use `py_mqtt_testing` for local testing and dashboard visualization of your devices.
